	<h1>Izar's hidden chapel</h1>
	<p title="Read: The Kybalion">You've just entered what is going to be Izar's retreat, also known as his hidden chapel. Right now you are witnessing just the foundations, well not even that! So please, do come back later, and maybe the opus has advanced a little bit more.</p>

	<p>The architects can go to their <a href="https://github.com/masterspore/centauro">repository</a> to keep working.</p>
